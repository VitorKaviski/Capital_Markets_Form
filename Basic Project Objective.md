# Capital_Markets_Form
Project Economy Form

Project carried out with the aim of facilitating the work and studies of economics students as well as economists and even anyone who wants to get involved with the financial market. The program is based on the semi-automated resolution of several formulas related to the Financial Market, and to obtain the answer to what it is to know, it is enough to have the requested unknowns, for example: in the formula X=Y+Z, in the program you would say that you would know the value of X, and the code would ask you for the value of Y and Z to give the value of X, just as you could also ask for the value of Y and the code would ask for the value of X and Z, and so on. The code is based on the use of Python in its version 3.10.2.

In the available files are present, construction base files generated by pyinstaller, application execution files with support for Windows, Linux and Mac, files with the program source codes based on pure Python with the dashboar interface generated by Tkinter, links to code and the program running in a Web support and some extra files related to the creation of the project.
